# üõí Decory ‚Äî Full Stack E-commerce Decoration Store

**Decory** is a fully functional full-stack e-commerce store for home decoration products.  
This project was built from a public Figma design and developed using modern web technologies.  
It serves as a portfolio project to demonstrate my frontend skills through a complete user experience, including browsing, filtering, purchasing, and user account management.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- This project was developed primarily as a **frontend portfolio showcase**.  
  The backend is powered by **Strapi**, which was used to enable dynamic product management.  
  While Strapi is powerful and flexible, this backend setup **was not designed for production use** and does not include full security hardening or backend validations.  
  There may be potential vulnerabilities if someone deliberately targets the server ‚Äî however, this is outside the intended scope of the project.

- The design was created based on a public Figma layout, optimized from **mobile up to 1440px** screen width.  
  The UI still looks acceptable on wider screens (like 1920px), though **some elements may appear slightly smaller than usual**.  
  This was a conscious design compromise and still provides a usable and clean experience across all screen sizes.
